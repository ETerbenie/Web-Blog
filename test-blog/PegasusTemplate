1. Login to your database

2. Click on Activity, then HOS, then Duty Status Logs

3. Search for the correct driver with the correct time frame and apply changes

***Retail Server restart***

We're currently experiencing a problem with our servers, live data that is being recorded by the ELD isn't being adjuted automatically. We're
reseeting our server so users in general will momentarily be unable to login/make any changes to logs. Once we've updated this issue, any live data will be backlogged and populated 
back into driver's profiles. We apologize  for any  inconvenience. 
//////////////////////

Automatic Drive log explanation, next time use PC

Automatic Drive logs are recorded whenever you move the vehicle above 5 mph, regardless of what status you are in (with the exception of YM and PC). Since you moved the vehicle above 5 mph it created an automatic Drive log in your profile, unfortunately there isn't really anything that can be done in this instance since the FMCSA doesn't allow the editing of automatic Drive logs. The only thing that can be done is annotating the Drive log indicating what happened. Going forward if you have to move the vehicle but still maintain an OFF duty status, I recommend using Personal Use (PC) so that it doesn't effect your rest break, or potentially give you violations. Thank you. 

////////////////////////////////////////


We were experiencing a problem with our servers, live data that was being recorded wasn't being added automatically and were being back logged instead, which is why it wasn't visible to any user.  We've reset the servers and the backlog data is being repopulated, we apologize for any inconvenience, thank you, 
///////

PC engine cycle 

Hello,

The reason why that happened is because when you place yourself into PC mode and then turn your engine off, it changes your status to an OFF duty status so you are no longer in PC. If you turn your engine on, within the app it prompts you "Do you want to remain in PC, yes or no" if you don't select anything it will keep you in OFF duty, therefore if you move above 5 mph an automatic D log is created. The only way to counteract this is to always make sure when you turn your engine on, that you are still in PC status. 

Unfortunately, the FMCSA does not allow the editing automatic Drive logs. This particular rule with the PC engine cycle is located within the mandate which is why the FMCSA does not allow the removal of this mistake. The only thing that can be done is editing the Drive log, indicating what happened.

Where was this?

Thank you for reaching out to support, the way the system works is that the ELD has has a SIM card that always has an internet connection, from there it uploads information to our servers to store that information. From there a driver would use a tablet/phone to use the app to access the server in order to retrieve that information. Therefore, if the device is indicating that error message, then there's a communication problem with the tablet/phone the driver is using connecting to the servers (usually stemming from a data connection problem), and not with the ELD. Generally the information is automatically populated into the the servers, and once the user obtains a data connection again, then they would have that information automatically generated back into their profile once they receive internet connection again.

1803 error in locations/miles : 

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to support, currently we are experiencing server problems with the upgraded 1803 servers. They are displaying "Error" in the locations and miles and aren't able to view their accurate information within the web portal, additionally, app users are encountering similar problems with the information not registering correctly and having a pop screen stating "unable to connect to servers". Information is still being recorded accurately from the ELD, it's just not reflecting onto the servers for some particular reason. We are actively trying to correct these problems, and we apologize for any inconvenience, thank you.

How to move logs : 

Follow these directions : 



1. Go to my.transfloeld.com/retaileld1



2. Click on Activity --> HOS --> Duty Status Logs 



3. Search for the driver with the wrong logs

No Connection to the Vechiel, Please ensure Telematicis :

The system works in 3 parts, the device you're using (phone or tablet) collects information from your use inputs and sends information to our servers (this requires a stable internet connection), the servers then collect and stores that information. The ELD itself works in a similar fashion, it records automatic D & ON logs from the movement of the vehicle, and then sends that information to the servers. There isn't any direct communication between your phone/tablet and the ELD, it's all communicated on the servers. The reason why that red banner is populated at the top of your app is because the device you're using doesn't have a stable enough connection to maintain connection to the servers when using the application, this is why the application requires internet connection in order to use it. Once your phone/tablet establishes a stable enough internet connection, then that error message disappears.

Continuous Drive log for days : 

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to ELD support, the reason why you are having that Drive log that is lasting for days is because the ELD is always meant to switch from an automatic Drive status to an automatic ON status after 5 minutes of idling. It looks like you uninstalled the ELD while the device was still in the drive status, which is why you're seeing that Drive log repeating for days. The ELD is not meant to be uninstalled because it does take you out of compliance. If there is ever any reason that you would need to uninstall the ELD, then ensure that your current status is not in Drive or else it will continue to repeat. 

Unfortunately, since this was an automatic Drive log it cannot be edited/removed, the only thing that can be  done is annotating the Drive log indicating what happened.

Customer wants to cancel :

Hello,



Thank you for reaching out to ELD support, in order to cancel there are a few things that we require in order to confirm the cancellation : 


1. Username (email address you registered with):



2. ELD serial number:


3. The reason you want to cancel: 


4. How do you want to cancel - suspend or termination  : 



Suspend mode : 



This still charges $10/month, but it keeps the ELD in an inactive state so that it is able to be used in the future. The reason for this charge is because each ELD has a SIM card located within it in order for the ELD to transmit data to our servers through an internet connection. In order to maintain that SIM card, we have that $10/month charge. 



Termination : 



This terminates the SIM card within the ELD from being used further. When this process is done, the ELD is no longer able to be used for future use.


Please respond back with these 4 things, and we will continue with your cancellation request. 
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Accidentally used YM : 

Thank you for reaching out to ELD support, YM and PC are considered exemption statuses. Under the FMCSA mandate, exemption status are consider movement logs and are permanent on a user's profile, there isn't anyway to remove those type of statuses from a profile. The only thing that can be done is annotating the log indicating what happened.
